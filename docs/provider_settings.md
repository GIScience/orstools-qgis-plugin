# Provider Settings

First, you'll have to [sign up](https://account.heigit.org/signup) and copy your API key from
your [HeiGIT account dashboard](https://account.heigit.org).

In the configuration window (`Web` > `ORS Tools` > `Configuration`) you have set up the API key, which will be saved
locally in a configuration file and will automatically be used across all tools. Here you can also set the base URL in
case you're using a self-hosted ORS version and the requests per minute you're allocated (usually set to 60).

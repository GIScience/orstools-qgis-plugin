As Geometry Input, choose a Point Layer. Only Point layers are allowed, NOT MultiPoint.

The ID field can be used to join the input layer afterwards. If not specified, it'll take the first field of the input layer.

The ranges parameter needs to be a comma-separated list of integer values, no decimal points. Current restriction limits apply, see https://openrouteservice.org/restrictions/.

The output layer is a Polygon layer with ID, range value, travel mode and total population (from GHSL). The CRS is EPSG:4326.

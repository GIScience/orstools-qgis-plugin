The Matrix algorithm returns a duration and distance matrix for multiple source and destination points.

You need to have a valid API key ('Web' menu > 'Configuration') or sign up at <a href="https://openrouteservice.org/sign-up/">https://openrouteservice.org/sign-up/</a>.

The Travel Mode determines the profile used.

For Start and End layers, only Point layers are allowed, NOT MultiPoint.

The Start and End ID fields can be used to join the input layers afterwards.

The output layer is a geometry-less table with ID, duration and distance attributes.

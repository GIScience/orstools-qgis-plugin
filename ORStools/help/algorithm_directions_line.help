The Line Directions algorithm calulcates least-cost routes for multiple waypoints along a LineString.

You need to have a valid API key for at least one provider (Web ► ORS Tools ► Configuration) or sign up at https://openrouteservice.org/sign-up/.

Both, LineString and MultiLineString layers are allowed.

The Travel Mode determines the profile used.

The Preference dictates the cost. For longer routes don't use Shortest.

The layer ID field can be used to join the input layer afterwards.

The output layer is a Polygon layer with multiple route attributes set.

For current restrictions, please see https://openrouteservice.org/restrictions/.

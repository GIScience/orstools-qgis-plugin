The Line Directions algorithm calculates least-cost routes for multiple waypoints along one or multiple LineString(s).
Each LineString can have up to 50 waypoints.

You need to have a <b>valid API key</b> for at least one provider (Web ► ORS Tools ► Configuration) or sign up at <a href="https://openrouteservice.org/sign-up/">https://openrouteservice.org/sign-up/</a>.
Current <a href="https://openrouteservice.org/restrictions/">restriction limits</a> for the openrouteservice API apply.

<i>Input layer</i>: LineString or MultiLineString layer.

<i>ID Field</i>: values will transfer to the output layer and can be used to join layers or group features afterwards.

<i>Travel Mode</i>: determines the profile used.

<i>Travel preference</i>: dictates the cost. For longer routes don't use Shortest Path.

You can optionally perform a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelling_salesman_problem">Traveling Salesman</a> on the waypoints of each MultiPoint feature.

<i>Advanced Parameters</i>: see <a href="https://giscience.github.io/openrouteservice/documentation/routing-options/Routing-Options.html">the documentation</a> for descriptions.

<i>Output layer</i>: a LineStringZ layer with multiple route attributes and <b>z dimension</b> set.

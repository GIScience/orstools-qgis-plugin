The Line Directions algorithm calculates least-cost routes for multiple waypoints along one or multiple LineString(s). Each LineString can have up to 50 waypoints.

You need to have a <b>valid API key</b> for at least one provider (Web ► ORS Tools ► Configuration) or sign up at <a href="https://openrouteservice.org/sign-up/">https://openrouteservice.org/sign-up/</a>.

Both, LineString and MultiLineString layers are allowed.

The layer ID field can be used to join the input layer afterwards.

The Travel Mode determines the profile used.

The Preference dictates the cost. For longer routes don't use <i>Shortest</i>.

You can optionally perform a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelling_salesman_problem">Traveling Salesman</a> on the waypoints of each MultiPoint feature.

The output layer is a LineStringZ layer with multiple route attributes and <b>z dimension</b> set.
